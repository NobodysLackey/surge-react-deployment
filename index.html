          This website will walk you through the steps to deploy a
          <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a>
          React app with <a href="https://surge.sh/" target="_blank">Surge</a>.
          We will walk through all of the necessary steps from start to finish,
          and even cover how you can choose a custom domain as well.

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Learn how to do a one-time install of Surge globally on your machine
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Is a React App a Static Site?</h2>
      <p>
        When we use the term "static", we are referring to the fact that the
        content of the website will not change unless the files are manually
        updated. The site does <em>not</em> interact with a database or involve
        any
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side" target="_blank"
          >server-side processing</a
        >. The site will simply display the same information to every user.
        Typically, static sites are faster and more secure than dynamic sites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technically, a React front-end is considered a static site because it
        serves pre-built files to the browser, and all necessary data is
        included within the initial load, meaning it doesn't need to query a
        database or server for every user request. The dynamic interactions are
        handled through JavaScript (<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page"
          target="_blank"
          >client-side</a
        >) which manipulates the DOM elements directly in the browser, without
        needing to fetch new pages or data from a server. This results in faster
        load times and a smoother user experience.
      </p>

      <p>This also means that we can use Surge to deploy it!</p>

      <p>
        Surge specializes in deploying and hosting these types of sites, and as
        a result, is extremely light-weight and fast. The feature we love the
        most is that Surge is extremely <em>easy to use</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>Installing Surge</h2>
      <p>
        Surge is very easy to install as well. We will perform a global install
        so that you will always have Surge available to deploy your projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><em>If you have never installed Surge before...</em></b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the following command from <em>any working directory</em> in your
        terminal:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="install">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>npm install --global surge</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Since it is global, this is an install you will only ever need to run
        <em><b>once</b></em
        >, not on a project-by-project basis.
      </p>

      <h2>Setting Up Your Surge Account</h2>
      <p>
        <b><em>If you have never signed up with Surge before...</em></b>
      </p>

      <p>In the root directory of your project, run the following command:</p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="surge-one">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>surge</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        You will be prompted to set up an account with Surge in your command
        line. Go ahead and do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, you'll be asked to confirm the project path. If you are in the
        root directory of your project, this should already be correct. Just
        press <kbd class="shadow">enter</kbd> to continue.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be automatically assigned a silly (usually) randomly generated
        domain name for your site. This is ok and we can change it later. Press
        <kbd class="shadow">enter</kbd> to continue.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/surge.gif" alt="deploy" class="image gif shadow" />

      <p>
        This may or may not succeed. Don't worry. Either way, we are not done
        yet.
      </p>

      <h3>Setting up Surge Environment Variables</h3>
      <p>
        In your front-end .env file (<b>touch .env</b> if you don't have one),
        add the following variables in <b>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</b>:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="env">
        <div class="code" id="env-block">
          <code>SURGE_LOGIN=</code>
          <code>SURGE_TOKEN=</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        <b>SURGE_LOGIN</b> will be the email you signed up for Surge with. No
        spaces, no quotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In your terminal, run the following command to get your Surge Token:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="token">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>npx surge token</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Paste the returned token to the above environment variable. No spaces,
        no quotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Make sure to add <b>.env</b> to your <b>.gitignore</b> file. Never
          push sensitive information up to GitHub!</em
        >
      </p>

      <h2>Setting Up a Custom Domain (optional)</h2>
      <p>
        We can set up a file in your project that will remember the particular
        domain you want to use. This step is entirely optional.
      </p>

      <h3>Choose a Domain</h3>
      <p>
        First, we'll need to see that the URL you want to use is available. Open
        a browser window and navigate to any surge domain you'd like.
      </p>

      <p>The URL should follow this format:</p>

      <div class="browser shadow">
        <code> https://reactdeployment.surge.sh/ </code>
      </div>

      <p>If it's available, the URL should show this in the browser:</p>

      <img src="./images/not-found.png" alt="not-found" class="image shadow" />

      <p>
        This means that no one else has deployed a project to this URL, and that
        it is available to be used. Remember this URL for the next step.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating A Custom Build Script</h3>

      <p>
        Next, we'll create a "build" script in our <b>package.json</b> that will
        perform all of the steps we need to run our deployment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add the following script <b><em>in</em></b> your
        <b>"scripts"</b> section of your <b>package.json</b> file.
      </p>

      <p>If you already have a "build" script, replace it:</p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="script">
        <div class="code">
          <code
            >"build": "vite build && touch ./dist/CNAME && echo
            &lt;SURGE_URL_IN_SINGLE_QUOTES&gt; >> ./dist/CNAME && npx surge
            --project ./dist --domain &lt;SURGE_URL_IN_SINGLE_QUOTES&gt;"</code
          >
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Obviously replace any <b>< ></b> in the above script with your own
        information. Pay close attention to the two URLs in the script above.
        <em><b>They should be in single quotes</b></em
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your <em><b>Surge URL</b></em> is what will be used as the entry point
        to your app. This is what people will see, and the one you'll want to
        put on your portfolio, LinkedIn, etc.
      </p>

      <p>This script performs the following actions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Runs the <em>vite build</em> command that creates a production build of
          our React App contained in a <b>/dist</b> folder
        </li>
        <li>Creates a new <b>CNAME</b> file in that <b>/dist</b> folder (we lose our old one each time a new <b>/dist</b> folder is created)</li>
        <li>Inserts the text of our chosen domain into that file</li>
        <li>
          Runs the <em>surge</em> command to redeploy our app. To ensure it runs
          automatically without needing any input from us, the
          following options are predefined:
          <ul>
            <li>The project directory: <b>--project ./dist</b></li>
            <li>The domain name: <b>--domain https://reactdeployment.surge.sh/</b></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Deploy</h2>

      <p>
        Any time you want to deploy, run that custom script you put in your
        <b>package.json</b> file. Do so from the root of your project:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="build">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>npm run build</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This will run the deployment of our Vite React App to Surge.</p>

      <h2>Recap</h2>
      <p>
        In this walkthrough, you successfully deployed your Vite React app to
        Surge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any time you make changes to your project that you want reflected on
        your deployed version, just commit your changes and then run
        <b>npm run build</b> once more.
      </p>
